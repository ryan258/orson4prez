        <p>
          Orson is a lovable, naive stuffed toy with big dreams of becoming the next President. 
          Despite his lack of political experience (or perhaps because of it), Orson believes 
          he can solve the world's problems with hugs, ice cream, and an unwavering belief in 
          the goodness of everyone. Join Orson on his whimsical journey to the White House!
